# Assignment
### 1. `.vscode/`

This folder contains specific configurations for the Visual Studio Code editor. It stores files for debugging (`launch.json`), C/C++ properties (`c_cpp_properties.json`), and workspace settings (`settings.json`) to ensure a consistent development environment.

### 2. `Cluster_Analysis&Opportunity_Evaluation/`

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) used for cluster analysis and opportunity evaluation. This part of the project focuses on analyzing the AI job market data to identify distinct job clusters and potential market opportunities.

### 3. `data_cleaning/`

Contains the Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing. The raw data is processed here to ensure data quality and correct formatting before any analysis is performed.

### 4. `dataset/`

Stores all data files required for the project. This includes the raw dataset (`ai_job_market.csv`), the cleaned dataset (`ai_job_market_cleaned.csv`), and other intermediate data files (e.g., cluster features, reports) generated during the analysis.

### 5. `feature_engineering/`

Contains the Jupyter Notebook used for feature engineering and analysis. This stage involves creating new, meaningful features from the existing data to improve the results of subsequent modeling and analysis (like clustering and time-series analysis).

### 6. `outputs/`

Used to store output files generated during the analysis, primarily charts and visualizations (as `.png` images). It is organized into subfolders (e.g., `Member2_figure`) to hold images produced by different analysis modules.

### 7. `requirements/`

Contains requirement documents and specifications (as `.pdf` files) related to the project. These files define the project's goals, scope, and deliverables, such as the project proposal and final project requirements.

### 8. `Time_Series_Analysis&Visualization_Report/`

Contains the Jupyter Notebook and related data ( `.csv`) used for time-series analysis and visualization. This part of the analysis focuses on studying the trends of AI job roles and skill demands over time.
